Perfect. For **in-person delivery**, you want to sound natural, confident, and solution-focused — like you’re already thinking one step ahead for their business.

Here’s a polished version you can **say casually** while sounding like a professional.

## 🗣️ Spoken Pitch (In-Person)


> **"Hey, so I’ve been thinking about the website we talked about earlier. Since you’re running a premium barbershop — and with so many tourists and locals in Khajuraho — it really makes sense to have a clean, modern website that matches your brand."**
>
> **"It’ll help people trust you before they even walk in — especially people who don’t know the area. Tourists literally search 'best haircut near me' — and right now, if you don’t show up well, they might never find you."**
>
> **"I’ll take care of the entire thing — design, layout, photos, services, contact buttons, Google Maps, whatever you need. The goal is to make it super easy for someone to say ‘Yes, I want to go there’ just by looking at your site."**
>
> **"It’ll work great on mobile too, because let’s be real — that’s where everyone is searching. And I’ll hook up WhatsApp or phone buttons so people can book instantly without changing how you operate."**


(Pause and read their body language.)


> **"I can have a first version ready in a few days. You’ll just need to send me some service names, prices, photos, and hours. I’ll show you a preview before anything goes live."**
>
> **"No stress on your end. I’ve got the design and tech handled — you’ll just have a premium site that works for your brand."**

### 🔁 Bonus Follow-Up (If They Ask “What Will It Look Like?”)


> **"It’ll have your logo at the top, maybe a bold tagline like ‘Khajuraho’s Premier Grooming Lounge’. Then I’ll show off the services — Haircut, Beard Trim, Hair Spa — with photos and clean pricing. At the bottom, people can call you or message instantly."**

### Optional Leave-Behind


If you want, I can prep a **1-page printed design mockup** or show a quick prototype on your phone. That makes the offer *feel real and ready* — it turns “maybe” into “yes.”

Would you like me to generate that mockup or design preview now? I can give you a simple, elegant one-pager you can pull up or print.
